# Personal Dotfiles

## Introduction

This is my personal dotfiles that I use daily and will be public for all to use. All dotfiles will
be commented so that readers can use it to learn just like Kickstart is commented to teach others how
how to create their own configs for neovim.

If you plan to use this dotfile, I would make sure to fork because I will be changing the structure of
of the dotfiles as I continue to develop the [manage-dotfiles](https://github.com/havocblast/manage-dotfiles) project
## Manager

This dotfile is setup to be used with my custom manager. I used this project to learn Python so it might
not be the best looking but oh well. You can still use my dotfiles with or without my manager by moving
the files around.

## Profiles

The structure of the dotfiles is setup to have different profiles that can be switched using my manager
so take a look at each profile to find something that you like.

## Applications

Here are the applications that I have dotfiles:

1. i3wm
2. zsh
3. starship
4. github-cli
5. tmux
6. kitty
7. neovim
8. polybar

more are to come..
